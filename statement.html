  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Andres Moscoso and I'm a class of 2023 undergrad student at SJSU and my goal as an artist is to inspire others to become artists themselves. The subjects I explore in my work are cultural influences and and real world art.
  The mediums I use while working are Adobe Premiere pro when working on videos and Map Map when im doing some projection mapping. The way I get my work to connect to others is by posting them on my youtube account or by showing them in my 
  portfolio for everyone to see.</p>
  <p>The video I did for my first project for art 75 was on how Hip Hop had has an influence in our culture. I wanted to show this by incorporating a TED talk and by including clips of real people showing how Hip Hop has affected them.
    I made the video in adobe premiere pro and added in effects to tie in all the clips. I'm always going back to see what I can improve in my art and continously nuild upon it so I can become a better artist for people, especially myself.
